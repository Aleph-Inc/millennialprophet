        "hisheal": "What We Believe\nWe believe in one God, who exists in three Persons \u2014 the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He is loving, holy and just.\nWe believe that the Bible is God\u2019s Word. It is inspired and accurate. It is our perfect guide in all matters of life.\nWe believe that sin has separated us all from God, and that only through Jesus Christ can we be reconciled to God.\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is both God and Man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He led a sinless life, took all our sins upon Himself, died and rose again. Today, He is seated at the right hand of the Father as our High Priest and Mediator.\nWe believe that salvation is the gift of God to man. This gift is effected by grace through faith in Jesus Christ and it produces works pleasing to God.\nWe believe that water baptism is an outward act that demonstrates a believer's identification with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus\nWe believe that the Holy Spirit is our Comforter. He guides us in all areas of our lives. He also blesses us with spiritual gifts and empowers us to yield the fruit of the Spirit.\nWe believe that the Holy Communion is a celebration of Jesus\u2019 death and our remembrance of Him.\nWe believe that God wants to transform, heal and prosper us, so that we can live blessed and victorious lives that will impact and help others.\nWe believe that we are called to preach the gospel to all nations.\nWe believe that our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again just as He promised.\nOur Core Values\nServe Out Of Rest\nWe can be productive and effective on the outside because we have God's peace and rest on the inside. Serving out of rest is not inactivity, but Spirit-directed activity.\nPeople Matter\nWe love and value every person because each of us matters to the Lord. In everything we do, we seek to glorify God and edify man.\nExcellence\nWe seek to excel in all that we do because we have the mind and Spirit of Christ.\nCutting Edge\nWe endeavour to be innovative and always at the forefront of all that we do. We are geared to the times but still anchored to the Rock.\nWe aspire to be innovative and always at the forefront of all that we do. We are geared to the times but still anchored to the Rock.\nHonour\nWe treat each other with respect and integrity. We honor and submit to our leaders as unto the Lord.",
